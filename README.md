# Express from Scratch

## 1. Install dependencies

Begin by creating the package-json file.
```Javascript
npm init -y
```
Then install the dependencies: express, express-handlebars, nodemon, body-parser, and forever. The syntax for installing express is provided below.
```Javascript
npm i express
```

Express is used as the framework for the web application, express-handlebars is used as the view engine, nodemon automatically reloads the web server whenever a change is made to the code, forever restarts the server if it crashes. body-parser is middleware used for parsing the body of HTTP requests, it is currently included with express and therefore we do not need to install it ourselves.

Remember to add a .gitignore file so that node_modules are not pushed up to github.

## 2. Set up app.js

App.js is set up so that our server can communicate with traffic from the internet. Our first step is to create the app.js file. As we are calling our main file app.js, not index.js, we must change the "main": in line 5 of package.json.
```JSON
"main": "app.js"
```

Then we set up app.js with the following:
```Javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 3000;
```

Then set up a basic route at the root to send back "Hello world":
```Javascript
app.get("/", (req, res) => {res.send("Hello world")})
```

Then set up the app to listed on a port:
```Javascript
app.listen(port, () => { console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`) })
```

Lastly, modify package.json with the script which will be used to run the server.
```JSON
"scripts": {
    "dev": "forever -c \"nodemon --exitcrash -L\" app.js"
},
```
The server can be run using:
```Javascript
npm run dev
```
